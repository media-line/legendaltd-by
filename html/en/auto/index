All the tankers function as "thermoses" that can preserve the freight temperature even under freezing temperatures of the environment (heat losses reach no more than 2-3 &ordm;C per diem). There are truck tankers for the transportation of special chemical freights of high temperature (up to 80 &ordm;C), with freight heating provided during transportation. Truck tankers allow for the transportation of freight under pressure.<br /><br />

Carrying equipment is the face of the company, therefore great attention is paid to the technical condition of trucks and semitrailers. The company has moved to a flexible approach to technical maintenance and repair of transport equipment. Not all the transportation routes pass through our city so we signed maintenance and repair services contracts with several service stations in various countries, with the main technical maintenance being rendered in Germany.
